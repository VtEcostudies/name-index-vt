A vermont name index for use with the ALA

ITIS-VT is generated from ITIS by processing the original file with node scripts.

Initially, the reason for this is to obfuscate ITIS LSIDs (DwCA taxonIDs) from ALA name-matching algorithms to prevent taxon mis-matches which incorrectly use Taxon GUID match without reference to a Master Taxonomic Index.
